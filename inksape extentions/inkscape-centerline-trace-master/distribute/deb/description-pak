A bitmap vectorizer that can trace along the centerline of a stroke. The
builtin inkscape 'trace bitmap' can only trace edges, thus resulting in double
lines for most basic use cases.

Written with python-Pillow. It uses 'autotrace -centerline' and an optimal
threshold to vectorize a pixel image. See centerline-tracing.svg for an
illustration of the idea.
